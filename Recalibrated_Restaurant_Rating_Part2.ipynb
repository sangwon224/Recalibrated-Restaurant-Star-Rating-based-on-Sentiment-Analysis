I got a funghi slice and an eggplant parmigiana slice.   My son got a buffalo chicken ranch and a pepperoni, and my husband got a Calabrese and a pepperoni.  There was no line at around 6:30 which was great, though they were clearly doing business.  Tables inside were about half taken.  It was very warm inside so we opted for the nice \"al fresco\" option they offer outside.  Pizza was reheated quickly, cut into pieces and promptly served to our table.  That said, although the crust was perfectly cooked - most of the toppings were disappointing.   Not \"bad\" pizza- but definitely not the finest NY has to offer.  Would I come back?  Sure.  Will it be a priority?   Nah.  If you\\'re looking for decent pizza, stop by.   If you\\'re looking for traditional NY pizza, keep looking.'"

The establishment boasts an impressive selection of 56 wines, complemented by a standby sommelier for those in need of guidance. The service, impeccably detail-oriented yet discreet enough not to disrupt conversations, attests to a refined dining experience. Crumbs vanish seamlessly, a testament to their attentiveness.\\n\\nRegrettably, the zenith of elegance encountered a nadir in the realm of cuisine. Opting for Potato Croquettes revealed a lack of seasoning, the only salvation being a modest application of salt. The Hiramasa Crudo, though impeccably fresh, proved too piscine for my palate, with the blood orange standing as the sole memorable note. The Grilled Lamb Neck, despite achieving culinary precision, left a void in flavor, a genuine letdown. However, salvation arrived in the form of the Farfalle Argentine Red Prawn, Puttanesca, a symphony of flavors harmonizing with flawlessly cooked prawns, redeeming the evening's culinary journey.\""
